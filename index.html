    <p id="forkingpath"> Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I understood. The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself. The phrase 'to various future times, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. In all fiction, when a man is faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others. In the almost unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them. He thus creates various futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out and bifurcate in other times. This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.</p>

    <p id="canoe"> No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, no one saw the bamboo canoe sink into the sacred mud, but in a few days there was no one who did not know that the taciturn man came from the South and that his home had been one of those numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of the mountain, where the Zend language has not been contaminated by Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What is certain is that the grey man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank with pushing aside (probably, without feeling) the blades which were lacerating his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and bloodstained, up to the circular enclosure crowned with a stone tiger or horse, which sometimes was the color of flame and now was that of ashes. This circle was a temple which had been devoured by ancient fires, profaned by the miasmal jungle, and whose god no longer received the homage of men. The stranger stretched himself out beneath the pedestal.</p>
    <p id="labyrinth"> Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms ... I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars.</p>
    <p id="son"> In general, his days were happy; when he closed his eyes, he thought: Now I will be with my son. Or, more rarely: The son I have engendered is waiting for me and will not exist if I do not go to him.</p>
    <p id="wiclif">in  the space  left  on  the  shelf  by  the  Wiclif,  but  in  the  end I  decided  to  hide  it  behind  the  volumes  of  a  broken set  of  The  Thousand  and  One  Nights.  I  went to  bed  and  did  not  sleep.  At  three  or  four  in  the morning,  I  turned  on  the  light.  I  got  down  the  impossible book  and  leafed  through  its  pages.  On one  of  them  I  saw an engraved  a  mask.  The  upper corner  of  the  page  carried  a  number,  which  I  no longer  recall,  elevated  to  the  ninth  power.</p>
    <p id="reflection">In this labyrinth of time, I found a reflection of my own thoughts and experiences. Each path I took seemed to lead to another, each decision branching off into a multitude of possibilities. It was a dizzying realization, one that made me question the very nature of choice and consequence. Was I, like Ts'ui Pen, creating my own reality with every decision I made? Or was I merely a traveler in a preordained maze, following a path laid out for me by forces beyond my control?</p>
    <p id="book">I  opened  the  book  at  random.  The  script  was strange  to  me.  The  pages,  which  were  worn  and typographically  poor,  were  laid  out  in  double  columns, as  in  a  Bible.  The  text  was  closely  printed, and  it  was  ordered  in  versicles.</p>
    <p id="numbers">In  the  upper corners  of  the  pages  were  Arabic  numbers.  I  noticed that  one  left-hand  page  bore  the  number  (let us  say)  40,514  and  the  facing  right-hand  page  999. I  turned  the  leaf;  it  was  numbered  with  eight digits.  It  also  bore  a  small  illustration,  like  the  kind used  in  dictionaries — an  anchor  drawn  with  pen and  ink,  as  if  by  a  schoolboy's  clumsy  hand.</p>
    <p id="examination">He was satisfied with the examination. He deliberately did not dream for a night; he took up the heart again, invoked the name of a planet, and undertook the vision of another of the principle organs. Within a year he had come to the skeleton and the eyelids. The innumerable hair was perhaps the most difficult task. He dreamed an entire man--a young man, but who did not sit up or talk, who was unable to open his eyes. Night after night, the man dreamt him asleep.</p>
    <p id="own">To  the  luck  of owning  it  was  added  the  fear  of  having  it  stolen, 
and  then  the  misgiving  that  it  might  not  truly  be infinite.  These  twin  preoccupations  intensified  my old  misanthropy.  I  had  only  a  few  friends  left;  I now  stopped  seeing  even  them.  A  prisoner  of  the 
book,  I  almost  never  went  out  anymore.  After studying  its  frayed  spine  and  covers  with  a  magnifying glass,  I  rejected  the  possibility  of  a  contrivance of  any  sort.  The  small  illustrations,  I  verified, came  two  thousand  pages  apart.  I  set  about  listing them  alphabetically  in  a  notebook,  which  I  was  not long  in  filling  up.  Never  once  was  an  illustration repeated.  At  night,  in  the  meager  intervals  my  insomnia granted,  I  dreamed  of  the  book.</p>

<!-- <p id="convo">"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. 
No doubt you want to see the garden?" 

Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. 

"The garden?" 

"The garden of forking paths." 

Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: 

"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen." 

"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."

<p id="enemy">I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, streams, or the West wind.</p> -->
